# What is Formicario?

**Formicario** is a programming game, i.e., a competition where each participant writes a program, after which the programs play against each other. The background story is as follows:

A series of mutually hostile ant colonies are established simultaneously on the surface of a torus (i.e., on a rectangular area where opposite sides meet each other). Scattered across this torus, there are piles of food that the ants can collect and bring back to their base, whereby new ants are born. Inevitably, violent confrontations arise between the different ant races in their struggle for survival and conquest...

The purpose of the game is, in other words, to program an ant algorithm that can most efficiently manage food collection, communication between the ants, as well as protection against and combat with the hostile ant teams.
